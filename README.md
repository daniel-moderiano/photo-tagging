# Where's Waldo at the Warp Core

A photo tagging application that has the user find Waldo and his freinds amongst the busy Warp Core Cafe. Top scores are saved on a Firebase backend for data persistence. 

This was a unique project built with vanilla JS that integrated a number of different features, from BaaS, to timers, to image coordinate coding.
